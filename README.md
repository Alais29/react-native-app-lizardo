### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/Alais29/react-native-app-lizardo#readme)

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

Create an .env file with all the necessary variables (use .env.example file as an example), you'll need to create a project on firebase, a google maps api key and a News API key (https://newsapi.org).

With that done you can run:

```sh
yarn run start
```

Once running, type "a" to run on Android Studio emulator or "w" to run on web (although the styles look terrible on web, not recommended).
