### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/Alais29/react-native-app-lizardo#readme)

- Light and Dark theme implemented with React Native Paper
- State management with Redux toolkit
- Stack and bottom navigation with React Navigation
- Camera and device location integration using google maps
- Integration with firebase: Authentication with email and password; profile image is uploaded to firebase storage; products, categories and orders are saved on firebase realtime database.
- News gotten from News API
- Integration with sqlite for saving user addresses
- Signup and Login form made with formik and Yup validation

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

Create an .env file with all the necessary variables (use .env.example file as an example), you'll need to create a project on firebase, a google maps api key and a News API key (https://newsapi.org).

Also, on firebase Realtime Database you need to import a json that includes products and categories, you can import the one on data/RTDB.json which is the data I used.

With that done you can run:

```sh
yarn run start
```

Once running, type "a" to run on Android Studio emulator or "w" to run on web (although the styles look terrible on web, not recommended).
